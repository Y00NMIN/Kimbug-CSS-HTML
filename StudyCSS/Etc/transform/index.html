    Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family
    Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are
    closely related. Most of the 60 species of eagle are from Eurasia and
    Africa.[1] Outside this area, just 14 species can be foundâ€”2 in North
    America, 9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia. Eagles are not
    a natural group but denote essentially any[citation needed] bird of prey
    large enough to hunt sizeable (about 50 cm long or more overall) vertebrate
    prey.
